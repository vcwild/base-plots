## Tools Used

- R language compiler
- R base graphic devices

## Files

  - **raw data set**: [Individual household electric power
    consumption](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
  - **CODEBOOK.md**: step-by-step on how to get from the raw data to the
    tidy data set.
  - **analysis.R**: a script able to process and clean the raw data into a
    fine tidy data set
