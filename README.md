================
> This is an exploratory data analysis on individual household electric
> power consumption by using the [UC Irvine Machine Learning
> Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

## Tools Used

- R language compiler
- R base graphic devices

## Files

  - **raw data set**: [Individual household electric power
    consumption](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
  - **[CODEBOOK.md](https://github.com/vcwild/base-plots/blob/master/CODEBOOK.md)**: step-by-step on how to get from the raw data to the
    tidy data set.
  - **[analysis.R](https://github.com/vcwild/base-plots/blob/master/analysis.R)**: a script able to process and clean the raw data into a
    fine tidy data set
  - **plotn.R**: the scripts that produces the plots in _images_ folder

### Note

In order for the **analysis.R** script to work, you need to download the
